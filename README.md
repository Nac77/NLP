Project 1: POS Word Tagger:

POS Word Tagger is used to accurately tag words and basically segment the sentences, to get a better understanding of the corpus.
Baseline tagger.py is the main file which you would want to run. 
To execute it, use command:

python3 baselinetagger.py <traindir> <testdir>.
  
<traindir> and <testdir> are going to be your training and testing directories which contain corpus training and testing data.
  
evaluate_model.py is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
